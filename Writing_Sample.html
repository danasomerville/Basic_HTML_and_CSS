				<h2>'It's the Last Thing Left'</h2>
				<h3>Lexington Park group wants to preserve old Carver Heights USO building as a museum, but county has plans to demolish it</h3>
				<h4>by Dana Somerville, Special to The Enterprise</h4>
				<p>
To passersby and the St. Mary’s County commissioners, the bluish-gray building on Lincoln Avenue in Lexington Park is a dangerous eyesore.<br><br>
					
The roof partially collapsed three years ago. Glass and trash litter the sidewalk and parking lot in front of the building. The windows and doors are boarded up with illegible graffiti decorating two of the planks and black-and-white ‘‘Keep Out” and ‘‘No Trespassing” signs marking two others.<br><br>
					
The light fixtures have turned a dirty shade of yellow, and a forgotten Transformer toy sits in the parking lot. Weeds and ivy have overtaken the building and its adjacent parking lot. Orange netting keeps the curious from venturing inside the building on every side but the right, where someone likely shoved it until it stretched and fell onto the excessively tall grass.<br><br>
					
To Virginia Nolan of Lexington Park, on the other hand, the building represents a piece of her childhood and a testament to the history of Carver Heights, now known as Southampton.<br><br>
					
‘‘The building means so much to us because that’s all we had back then,” Nolan said. ‘‘It’s the last thing left.”<br><br>
					
The now-abandoned building in Southampton was originally a United Service Organization building for African-American soldiers and civilians stationed at Patuxent River Naval Air Station.<br><br>
					
Nolan and her organization, Save the Village Inc., are attempting to rescue the former USO building from demolition. The county commissioners, on the other hand, have put money in the budget to raze it.<br><br>
					
The recommendation comes following a report on workforce housing. On May 22, the St. Mary’s County Community Workforce Housing Task Force presented the commissioners with recommendations for enhancing ‘‘traditional” neighborhoods for those looking for moderately priced homes in St. Mary’s. The task force recommended that either the county put money in the budget to take care of the building, turn it over to a private or nonprofit organization or demolish the building.<br><br>
					
So $125,000 was put into the county government’s budget to tear the building down, said George Erichsen, director of the St. Mary’s County Department of Public Works and Transportation. ‘‘The budget was put together by the commissioners to address the blight. I recommended demolishing it from a building-maintenance standpoint.”<br><br>
					
‘‘In St. Mary’s County, we have an issue that’s getting worse, and that is a lack of workforce housing,” County Commissioner Daniel H. Raley (D) said. ‘‘One way to address the issue is to improve the infrastructure of traditional housing. I’m also concerned about the building, but the county’s got a liability issue here. One wall has already collapsed.”<br><br>
					
‘‘Their intentions were probably good,” Teresa Wilson, the historic preservation planner for the county’s department of land use and growth management, said of the demolition plan. ‘‘They probably didn’t know about its history.”<br><br>
					
Raley disagreed. ‘‘I’m very, very much aware of the historical significance,” he said. ‘‘We need to do something to let people know about what happened there.”<br><br>
					
According to the Maryland Historical Trust and Nolan, the USO building contained a housing office, a barbershop, a beauty salon, a kitchen, a dining room and a great hall. The building was also used as one of the original homes to First Missionary Baptist Church, an elementary school and a meeting space for children who were involved in the Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts or 4-H club.<br><br>
					
‘‘We had card games, parties, a swing behind the USO building, block parties and a teen club,” Velma Francis of Lexington Park said. ‘‘It wasn’t a whole lot, but it was something. It was like one big family. They didn’t keep anybody from coming to things because it was all we had.”<br><br>
					
‘‘This was the only area for people of color from ‘the outside,’” Wilson said.<br><br>
					
‘‘We’re indebted to this building,” Nolan said. ‘‘It served so many people at different things. It’s priceless.”<br><br>
					
The USO building was slated for demolition this year. Following a meeting among Sen. Roy Dyson (D-St. Mary’s, Calvert, Charles), County Administrator John Savich and St. Mary’s County Commission President Francis Jack Russell (D), that may be reconsidered. With Dyson’s support, the legislature authorized a state grant of $250,000 to help preserve the building, but that money must be matched.<br><br>
					
‘‘We could deed [the property] over to [Save the Village Inc.], demolish part of the building or salvage part of the building,” Erichsen said. ‘‘In the meantime, what we have is a risk issue. If there’s a way we can secure it in the interim, we want to make sure those plans are amenable to the people who want to save it.”<br><br>
					
The building was vacated in 2002 when the Jarboe Center in Great Mills opened. The health department annex and Head Start program, which were the last to use the building, moved from Southampton to the Jarboe Center.<br><br>
					
‘‘It’s a shame that, a lot of times when a building is vacant, maintenance takes priority and [governing bodies] don’t take care of them,” Wilson said. ‘‘There are probably people out there that can’t understand why Mrs. Nolan would want to save the building and there are some that are on board with Save the Village.”<br><br>
					
Nolan and Save the Village hope to turn the building into a museum chronicling the USO and African-American education in St. Mary’s. The plan is to have memorabilia from the USO and African-Americans living in Carver Heights during World War II, rooms depicting the history of African-Americans in St. Mary’s County, teachers and educators, and other cultures here. Other attractions could include storytelling as well as historical movies and slide shows.<br><br>
					
Save the Village also plans to place a statue honoring African-American veterans of World War II and the Civil War between the baseball diamond on Route 235 in Lexington Park and the former USO building. ‘‘After all, they have statues of other people,” Nolan said. ‘‘We want people to know that we’ve done a lot for our country.<br><br>
					
‘‘All history is important, so why not work with us to save ours?” Nolan added. ‘‘If we can have an opportunity to share our own history, look how a community can come about. I would like to see students, the young and old, come to the museum. It can be a place to teach and help motivate students and help them shine a little brighter. Don’t keep us from having our history alive. We contributed a lot to St. Mary’s County as a race.”<br><br>
					
‘‘I just feel we could do a better job to preserve our history,” Wilson said. ‘‘There’s a lot of African-American history here and it needs to be better marketed.”<br><br>
					
‘‘I’m not here to fight with the county government,” Nolan said. ‘‘That is not my intention. ... I started out asking to turn this building into an educational museum, [because] that’s all we had. The Navy base is how we survived. When their military men had programs there, they always had the community involved. It was a community helping each other and raising our kids. That’s why the building means so much.”<br><br>
					
Raley suggested erecting a pavilion detailing the history of Carver Heights and the USO building and place a playground near the structure. ‘‘Wouldn’t it be better to remove the eyesore and put up something to memorialize [the USO building] and have a playground for the kids?” Raley said.<br><br>
					
No formal discussions have taken place regarding the aftermath of the demolition. ‘‘We’re taking it one step at a time,” Raley said.<br><br>
					
Nolan smiled when she thought of those who see the building as just an eyesore. ‘‘Even if someone doesn’t agree with what we’re doing, that’s their opinion,” she said. ‘‘I’m not gonna say they’re right or wrong. They don’t know the story of this community. You have to have an open mind and heart. Then, you’ll understand what we felt back then and why we want to turn this into a museum. Divided, we fall. But together, we can stand. Negative temptation should never divide us.<br><br>
					
‘‘You know, a lot of buildings were an eyesore to a community, but it was turned around,” Nolan added. ‘‘So why can’t we turn ours into something beautiful?”<br><br>
					
‘‘I’m willing to talk about it,” Raley said. ‘‘I want to do what’s best for the community.<br>
